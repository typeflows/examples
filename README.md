# Typeflows Examples

## Overview

Typeflows is a type-safe GitHub configuration platform that replaces manual GitHub management with programmable, testable, and shareable code. You can use Typeflows to manage your entire `.github/` folder - workflows, security policies, branch protection, and more. This repository contains project examples demonstrating how to use Typeflows across different programming languages and build systems.

Stop copy-pasting configurations between repositories and start treating your GitHub setup as infrastructure!

## Supported Platforms

- **JVM** - Kotlin/Java examples for complete `.github/` folder management
  - [`jvm/gradle`](jvm/gradle/) - Gradle-based example with workflows, security policies, and GitHub configuration

## Getting Started

Each platform has its own specific setup and usage instructions. Please refer to the README in each example directory for detailed guidance.
